            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Noah Sage, and I am currently 21 years old. I going to be a senior at Michigan State University, 
                majoring in Information Science. Having high hopes of when day competing in the olympics and proffesionally 
                I dedicate most of my time to training and improving my performance on the track as well as watching film 
                of other sprinters in my event to learn new things from and gain more knowledge.</p>
            <p>When my running career comes to an end, I plan to coach track and field, sharing 
                my knowledge with other up and coming athletes. I also love weight lifting and bodybuilding, 
                which tend help to get me into better shape for running and allow me to have the strength for my races.</p>
