            <p>Hello! My name is Noah Sage, an incoming senior at Michigan State University majoring in Information Science. 
                As a member of the track and field team, I have spent hours on end training and competing my hardest. 
                Here, I share all of my experiences and thoughts from being a D1 athlete.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of Anxiety on Sports Performance</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2024-06-01">June 1, 2024</time> by <span>Noah Sage</span></p>
            <img src="images/1701778248772.png" alt="Anxiety in Sports" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
            <p>Sports performance can be significantly affected by anxiety. As athletes, we often 
                face lots of pressure to perform well, which can lead to anxiety and stress causing us to not compete at our best. 
                This anxiety can affect us in many ways, such as physical symptoms like 
                increased heart rate and fatigued before competing, as well as mental symptoms such as negative 
                thinking and lack of focus, or even feeling you are not phsyically present.</p>
            <p>Understanding how to manage anxiety is essential for athletes. Techniques such as deep breathing, 
                visualization, and positive self-talk can help mitigate the effects of anxiety. It's also important 
                to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition and adequate sleep, to support overall well-being 
                and performance.</p>
            <p>By addressing anxiety head-on and incorporating stress management strategies into our routine, we can improve our 
                performance and enjoy our sports while having fun. If you're struggling with anxiety in sports, remember that you're 
                not alone and there are resources and support available to help you overcome these challenges.</p>
